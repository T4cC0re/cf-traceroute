# cf-traceroute

Perform `traceroute` from the Cloudflare Network to various targets.

NOTE: Pretty rough first cut and depends on
https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/pull/520 to work. Once you
have that dependency, this will work.

Tests and functionality will be expanded in the future once that the
above lands.
